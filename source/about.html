          <h2>360 Resources</h2>
          <p>The 360 Resource is a repository of resources to aid individuals working to help foundations be more data-informed. The main purpose is to expose Data Champions to tried and true resources that other champions have found helpful, but also to connect directly with other data champions to get advice. Itâ€™s a people library as much as a resource library.</p>

          <p>The Resource Library began during a workshop for the UKCF Data Champions Pilot as a brain-dump sticky note exercise.</p>
